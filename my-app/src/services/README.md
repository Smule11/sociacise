Definition: Services are used to encapsulate business logic, particularly logic that interacts with external APIs or databases.
Purpose: They provide a layer of abstraction for operations like fetching data, posting data to a server, or performing complex calculations.
Example: A UserService might handle fetching user data from a server, while an AuthService manages user authentication.
