Definition: Components are reusable UI elements in your application. In frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, components are the building blocks of your user interface.
Purpose: They encapsulate functionality and styling, and can be used and reused throughout the application for a consistent and maintainable codebase.
Example: A button, a navigation bar, a form, or a date picker.
